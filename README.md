# bored app

---

This is a project that I made for learning [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) and for fun.
This project is made possible by using [bored-api](https://www.boredapi.com/).
The API from bored-api is used as the backend for the appication, all the options used in the application are unmodified and directly following the specifications from bore-api [documentation](https://www.boredapi.com/documentation).

## Get started

1. Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/g-chandran/bored-app.git
```

2. Move to the folder and install the dependencies

```
cd bored-app
npm i
```

3. Start the localhost server in development mode

```
npm run dev
```

## Fun-Fact

As I wanted to dig deeper into web, I've used no third-party packages for this project.

From Loading animations to Sliders, each component is started from scratch. **That's what real fun is!**

_Demo and Live link will be added soon_
